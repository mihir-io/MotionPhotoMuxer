Convert Apple Live Photos into Google Motion Photos commonly found on Android phones.

# Installation

As of right now, this script only has one dependency, `py3exiv2`. Unfortunately
this requires building a C++ library to install, so you need to install a C++ toolchain.

Using Ubuntu as an example:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-all-dev libexiv2-dev libboost-python-dev python3 python3-pip python3-venv
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Installing on a Pixel/Android Phone

* Install [Termux from the F-Droid App store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
* Install the following packages within Termux in order to satisfy the dependencies for `pyexiv2`:

~~~bash
'pkg install python3'
'pkg install openssl'
'pkg install git'
'pkg install build-essential'
'pkg install exiv2'
'pkg install boost-headers'
git clone https://github.com/mihir-io/MotionPhotoMuxer.git
python3 -m pip install -r MotionPhotoMuxer/requirements.txt
~~~

This should leave you with a working copy of MotionPhotoMuxer directly on your Pixel/other Android phone.
You may want to make sure Termux has the "Storage" permission granted from within the system settings, if
you plan on writing the output files to the `/sdcard/` partition.


# Usage

~~~
usage: MotionPhotoMuxer.py [-h] [--verbose] [--dir DIR] [--recurse] [--photo PHOTO] [--video VIDEO] [--output OUTPUT] [--copyall]

Merges a photo and video into a Microvideo-formatted Google Motion Photo

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --verbose        Show logging messages.
  --dir DIR        Process a directory for photos/videos. Takes precedence over --photo/--video
  --recurse        Recursively process a directory. Only applies if --dir is also provided
  --photo PHOTO    Path to the JPEG photo to add.
  --video VIDEO    Path to the MOV video to add.
  --output OUTPUT  Path to where files should be written out to.
  --copyall        Copy unpaired files to directory.
~~~

A JPEG photo and MOV or MP4 video must be provided. The code only does simple
error checking to see if the file extensions are `.jpg|.jpeg` and `.mov|.mp4`
respectively, so if the actual photo/video encoding is something funky, things
may not work right.

> **Note**
> The output motion photo tends to work more reliably in my experience if the input video is H.264 rather than HEVC.

This has been tested successfully on a couple photos taken on an iPhone 12 and
uploaded to Google Photos through a Pixel XL, but there hasn't been any
extensive testing done yet, so use at your own risk!
